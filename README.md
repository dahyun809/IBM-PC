# IBM PC
Before it was possible to equip a personal computer, however the need of having one did not stand out much to people. The introduction of IBM 5150 Personal Computer changed this view towards computers by enabling users to process texts and play games expanding the use of a computer for entertainment purposes. It is the starting point of the x86[^1] architecture that is commonly used today. In other words, it is the direct founder of the PC we use today.
[^1]: Developed by the Intel Corporation, x86 is an instruction set architecture (ISA) series for computer processors. It defines how a processor handles and executes different instructions passed from the operating system (OS) and software programs. IBM PC Compatible âŠ‚ Models x86 Architecture

# CPU

   * Intel 8080 processor-Due to timing problems such as graphic synchronization and clock oscillator unite price problems that generate clocks, IBM PCs use 4.77 MHz, which is about 4% underclocked to the original basic clock 5MHz.

# RAM

   * At first release 64KB was built into and 256KB of memory was built into the later version. For affordable prices the memory could be reduced to 16KB. However DOS (disk operating system) was unable[^3] to be used in the 16KB specification and could be only used as an cassette basic because the kernel of DOS 1.x[^2] alone reached 10KB. Considering that the maximum memory of Apple II could fit was 64KB, 256KB was a immensely large capacity, which compuled with its fast CPU processing worked amazingly for offices.
   [^2]: An IBM branded version of MS-DOS licensed from Microsoft for use on the IBM PC system.
   [^3]: For this reason, IBM designed systems with the memory of 16KB, ignoring the situation of booting DOS from floppy disks.

# ROM BIOS

  * BIOS is the firmware[^4] for IBM PCs and it occupies a single 8KB chip on the motherboard. It provides bootstrap[^5] code and a library of common functions that all software can use for various purposes, such as video output, keyboard input, disk access, interrupt handling, memory testing, and other functions.
[^4]: A form of microcode or program embedded into hardware devices to help them operate effectively.
[^5]: To boot or to load a program into a computer using a much smaller initial program to load in the desired program.

# STORAGE

  * The two bays at the front of the machine can hold to two 5.25 inch floppy disk drives, storing 160KB per disk surface for a total storage of 320KB per disk. The floppy drive has a controller card inserted in the expansion slot and should be connected by his one ribbon cable with two edge connectors. The IBM floppy controller card has an external 37-pin D-sub connector for connecting external disk drives, but IBM didn't offer it for purchase until 1986. IBM PC had a port for connecting a cassette data recorder, however unlike other typical home computers at that time it was not the primary vehicle for software distribution. This is because majority of the PCs were sold with a floppy drive. This port was removed in the next PC model, the XT. After the release of XT, IBM changed[^5] the design of 5150 to add features except for the upgraded power supply. 
      [^5]: IBM did not offer a hard drive option, making it difficult to add a hard drive option. The standard PC power supply did not provide enough power to run the hard drive, and the motherboard did not support the BIOS expansion ROM required to support the hard drive controller. Also, both PC DOS and BIOS did not support hard disks.
