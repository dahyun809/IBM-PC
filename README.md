# IBM PC
Before it was possible to equip a personal computer, however the need of having one did not stand out much to people. The introduction of IBM 5150 Personal Computer changed this view towards computers by enabling users to process texts and play games expanding the use of a computer for entertainment purposes. It is the starting point of the x86[^1] architecture that is commonly used today. In other words, it is the direct founder of the PC we use today.
[^1]: Developed by the Intel Corporation, x86 is an instruction set architecture (ISA) series for computer processors. It defines how a processor handles and executes different instructions passed from the operating system (OS) and software programs. x86 Architecture âŠƒ IBM PC Compatible Models

## About
1. CPU

   Intel 8080 processor-Due to timing problems such as graphic synchronization and clock oscillator unite price problems that generate clocks, IBM PCs use 4.77 MHz, which is about 4% underclocked to the original basic clock 5MHz.

2. RAM

   At first release 64KB was built into and 256KB of memory was built into the later version. For affordable prices the memory could be reduced to 16KB. However DOS (disk operating system) was unable[^3] to be used in the 16KB specification and could be only used as an cassette basic because the kernel of DOS 1.x[^2] alone reached 10KB. Considering that the maximum memory of Apple II could fit was 64KB, 256KB was a immensely large capacity, which compuled with its fast CPU processing worked amazingly for offices.
